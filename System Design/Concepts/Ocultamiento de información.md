David Parnas's famous paper On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems Into Modules \[Parnas72\] is an example of classics often cited but seldom read. In it, Parnas introduces the concept of information hiding. Perhaps because the term sounds like the idea of data encapsulation, it has been misinterpreted as that, and some books erroneously define the concepts as synonyms. Rather, Parnas intended information hiding to mean hide information about the design from other modules, at the points of difficultly or likely change. To quote his discussion of information hiding as a guiding design principle:
<cite>
	We propose instead that one begins with a list of difficult design decisions or design decisions which are likely to change. Each module is then designed to hide such a decision from the others.
</cite>
That is, Parnas's information hiding is the same principle expressed in [[Variaciones protegidas|PV]], and not simply data encapsulationâ€”which is but one of many techniques to hide information about the design. However, the term has been so widely reinterpreted as a synonym for data encapsulation that it is no longer possible to use it in its original sense without misunderstanding.
