When you design and build large or complex microservice-based applications with multiple client apps, a good approach to consider can be an API Gateway. This pattern is a service that provides a single-entry point for certain groups of microservices. It's similar to the [[Facade]] pattern from object-oriented design, but in this case, it's part of a distributed system. The API Gateway pattern is also sometimes known as the "backend for frontend" ([[Back for front|BFF]]) because you build it while thinking about the needs of the client app.

Therefore, the API gateway sits between the client apps and the microservices. It acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests from clients to services. It can also provide other cross-cutting features such as authentication, SSL termination, and cache.
